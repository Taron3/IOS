/*:
# A Swift Queue
Implement a linear data structure which has a **FIFO** order.
Your implementation should include the following operations:

* `init(size)` - Initializer with a parameter to fix the size of the queue.
* `enqueue(elem)` - Insert an element into the queue. Return `true` if the operation was successful.
* `dequeue()` - Remove the next element from the queue. Return a boolean indicating the status of operation.
* `isEmpty` - Checks whether the queue is empty or not.
* `isFull` - When initialized with a fixed size, checks whether the count of elements in the queue reached the size or not.
* `front` - Returns the next element in queue.
* `rear` - Returns the last element in queue.

When designing your queue consider the following implementations below:
 
 [C++ - std::queue](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/) \
 [GeeksforGeeks - Queue Implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-set-1introduction-and-array-implementation/)

 * Callout(Tip):
 You can write your implementaition either on this page or in a seprate source file (in `Sources` folder for this page) and do some tests here.
